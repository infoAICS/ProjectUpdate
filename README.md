# ProjectUpdate
[Observable](https://observablehq.com/@unknowncoder-ws/project485)


**Describe modifications**
The biggest thing we had to think about after our first proposed prototype is how to make our project interactive. So one of the ways we thought about is to make our maps - which we made using mapbox library- have a tooltip. we modifyed are approach y combining two indeas from our sheet into one interactive mao that has more features. other than mapbox we used vegalite to layer the points in to the map and d3 will be used too like the approach in one of the toturials on observable.


**Milestones**
	
We struggled a lot with doing the proposal so we are not on schedule we submitted the proposal again and got very helpful feedback that was essiential in our modifyed approach into making our map inteactive
